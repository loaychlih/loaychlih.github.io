# AI Researcher & Engineer  
# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Loay

I'm an **AI Engineer Intern @ Veepee** in Paris, France, where I'm working on benchmarking and evaluating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for real-world business use cases.  
Currently completing my **Masterâ€™s in Natural Language Processing** at the University of Nantes. I'm passionate about **Generative AI**, NLP, and building scalable AI tools that solve practical problems.

I'm actively **seeking a position in Generative AI**, where I can contribute to research and development in LLMs, evaluation methods, and responsible AI systems.

## Work Experience

**AI Engineer Intern @ Veepee (Ventes PrivÃ©es), Paris (_Feb 2025 â€“ Aug 2025_)**  
### Designed and developed "Model Arena": a platform for evaluating and comparing LLMs on use cases specific to Veepee.
- At Veepee, any decision about LLMs now goes through this platform. Itâ€™s been adopted by several tech teams and has become the go-to standard for making reliable, traceable, and comparable LLM choices.
- Designed of a scalable backend with message queues and asynchronous workers to orchestrate multi-provider API calls (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) using a system of dynamic templates and structured output formats.
- Built an **LLM-as-a-Judge** evaluation pipeline to automate qualitative output assessments.
- Integrated flexible evaluation metrics (accuracy, cost, token usage).
- **Tools:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, React, LLM APIs.

**AI Research & Development Assistant @ AI Movement, Rabat (_Feb 2024 â€“ Jul 2024_)**  
### Integrated ML into Branch-and-Bound algorithms for solving TSP.
- Creation of a pipeline for generating TSP instances and benchmarking machine learning models.
- Improved TSP solution time by integrating a GCNN model: gains of 11.44% for TSP-15, 16.24% for TSP-20, and 10.26% for TSP-25.
- **Tools:** PyTorch, SCIP, Numpy, Docplex, Weight&Biases.

**Data Science Intern @ SQLI, Rabat (_Jul 2023 â€“ Sep 2023_)**  
### Built a web-based **sentiment analysis** pipeline for e-commerce reviews.
- Data extraction through web scraping and benchmarking of sentiment analysis models to identify the best-performing one.
-  Integration of the best model as an API, enabling users to analyze their data via a web page.
- **Tools:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, Streamlit.
